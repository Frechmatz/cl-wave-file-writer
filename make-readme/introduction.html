<p>A Common Lisp package for generating wave (.wav) audio files. Supports sample widths of
  8, 16 and 24 Bits, any sample rate and any number of channels. The package does not
  buffer samples in memory, so files of arbitrary size can be created without impacting
  the memory footprint of the application.</p>
