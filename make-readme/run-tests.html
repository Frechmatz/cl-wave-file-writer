<p>The library unfortunately does not have a test suite.
    For manual testing, an example that creates Wave files for multiple sample rates, sample widths and number of channels can be found <a href="https://github.com/Frechmatz/cl-wave-file-writer/blob/master/examples/example-2.lisp">here</a>. A Matlab script for plotting multi-channel Wave files can be found <a href="https://github.com/Frechmatz/cl-wave-file-writer/blob/master/matlab/plotwavefile.m">here</a>.
