cl-wave-file-writer
===================

A Common Lisp package for generating wave (.wav) audio files. Supports sample widths of
8, 16 and 24 Bits, any sample rate and any number of channels. The package does not
buffer samples in memory, so files of arbitrary size can be created without impacting
the memory footprint of the application.


The full documentation can be found in the `docs` directory or at the [project
site](https://frechmatz.github.io/cl-wave-file-writer/).
